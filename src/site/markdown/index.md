## Geomatics Utilities

This component provides support for processing spatial data and associated 
metadata using various [Geotk modules](http://www.geotoolkit.org/). The Geotk 
3.x library implements the [GeoAPI v3](http://www.geoapi.org/) interfaces. 
Some of the utility methods compensate for deficient or partial support for 
GML 3.2.1 data representations.

**Note**: Work has started on migrating significant portions of the Geotk 4.x 
code base to the [Apache SIS](http://sis.apache.org/) project.
